## Application Patterns and Examples <a name="patterns"></a>
Have ideas for other patterns? Open an PR and create a new folder under examples. Or simply open an issue and we can discuss it. 

| Name          | Example Description                      | Community Projects        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [LLM Agent](examples/llm_agents) | Thought, Action, Observation Agent built from scratch | [Microsoft's Jarvis](https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS), [Google's Palm](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/), [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)|
| [ChatGPT Plugin](examples/plugin) | A plugin looking up real time Bart schedule | |

## Tools <a name="tools"></a>
Common tools you will come across as you explore projects built in the community. 

| Name | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) | Framework | A lightweight web framework for Python. Since Python is the language of AI, you might as well use a web framework in Python. Another common option is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). |
| [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) | Framework | A popular Javascript framework, often used with Vercel. |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | Infra & Hosting | A cloud platform specialized in hosting Next.js apps. |
| [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) | Framework | A utility-first CSS framework, which means you will define styling directly with pre-built css classes. |
| [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/docs) | Infra & Hosting | A vector database for AI applications. This is commonly used to store embeddings of data and enable similarity based search (More on this in Q&A bots). Alternatively, you can also use [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) and [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) and others. |
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) | Infra & Hosting | A popular PostgresQL as a service vendor. Works well with NextJS and offers Authentication and storage APIs out of the box. Also has support for storing embeddings (using a Postgres plugin - pgvector) and files. |
| [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) | Framework | A library that provides an interface between LLMs and external data by handling data connectors, building indices and querying (e.g., including managing prompt token size, etc.). |
| [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) | Framework | A library that helps you build LLM based complex action chains and agents. |
| [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) | API | Currently the state of the art models. Commonly used APIs include: <ul><li>Whisper - Audio to text. This is also open-sourced, so you can run your own service.</li><li>Embedding - Generate high dimensional representation based on text and can be used for semantic search.</li><li>Text completions and chat completions - The API behind ChatGPT. Multiple models exist. gpt-4 is the state of art, but general use cases can be done on gpt-3.5-turbo (cheaper and faster).</li><li>DALLE - Text to image.</li></ul> |
| [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) | Infra & Hosting | The GitHub for AI models, a platform to build, deploy, and share models across the community. An alternative to OpenAI models. |
| [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) | API | AI text to speech API. Voice cloning. |
| [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) | API | Run open-source machine learning models with a cloud API. |

## Models <a name="models"></a>
A list of the more "hackable" models and how to work with them. 

| Name | Description | Size | Data | OSS & License | How to work with it |
|------|-------------|------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| LLaMA | Foundational 65B LLM from Meta AI | 65B |  | Yes (Research only) | [Hosting](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) |
| Dolly 2.0 | Open source, instruction-following LLM | 12B | 15,000 high-quality human-generated prompt / response pairs | Yes (Commercial use friendly) |  |
