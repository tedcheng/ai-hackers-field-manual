## Application Patterns and Examples <a name="patterns"></a>
| Name          | Example Description                      | Community Projects        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| [LLM Agent](examples/llm_agents) | Thought, Action, Observation Agent built from scratch | [Microsoft's Jarvis](https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS), [Google's Palm](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/), [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)|
| [ChatGPT Plugin](examples/plugin) | A plugin looking up real time Bart schedule | |
| Semantic Search and Q&A Bots | ðŸš§ Under Construction | |

## Tools <a name="tools"></a>
Common tools you will come across as you explore projects built in the community. Some of these tools and frameworks may not be specific to LLM use cases, but have become the default choice of the community. Feel free to use other tools you like but it's good to generally know these. 

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) | A lightweight web framework for Python. Since Python is the language of AI, you might as well use a web framework in Python. Another common option is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). |
| [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) | A popular Javascript framework, often used with Vercel. |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | A cloud platform specialized in hosting Next.js apps. |
| [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) | A utility-first CSS framework, which means you will define styling directly with pre-built css classes. |
| [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/docs) | A vector database for AI applications. This is commonly used to store embeddings of data and enable similarity based search (More on this in Q&A bots). Alternatively, you can also use [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) and [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) and others. |
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) | A popular PostgresQL as a service vendor. Works well with NextJS and offers Authentication and storage APIs out of the box. Also has support for storing embeddings (using a Postgres plugin - pgvector) and files. |
| [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) | A library that provides an interface between LLMs and external data by handling data connectors, building indices and querying (e.g., including managing prompt token size, etc.). |
| [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) | A library that helps you build LLM based complex action chains and agents. |
| [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) | Currently the state of the art models. Commonly used APIs include: <ul><li>Whisper - Audio to text. This is also open-sourced, so you can run your own service.</li><li>Embedding - Generate high dimensional representation based on text and can be used for semantic search.</li><li>Text completions and chat completions - The API behind ChatGPT. Multiple models exist. gpt-4 is the state of art, but general use cases can be done on gpt-3.5-turbo (cheaper and faster).</li><li>DALLE - Text to image.</li></ul> |
| [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) | The GitHub for AI models, a platform to build, deploy, and share models across the community. An alternative to OpenAI models. |
